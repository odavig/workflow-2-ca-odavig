An early highlight of the Space Race, its goal was to put a man into Earth orbit and return him safely, ideally before the Soviet Union. Taken over from the US Air Force by the newly created civilian space agency NASA, it conducted twenty uncrewed developmental flights (some using animals), and six successful flights by astronauts. The program, which took its name from Roman mythology, cost $2.25 billion adjusted for inflation.[1][n 2] The astronauts were collectively known as the \"Mercury Seven\", and each spacecraft was given a name ending with a \"7\" by its pilot.</p> <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mercury/missions/program-toc.html\">Read more here</a>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"kol-6 sectionParagraph\">\r\n              <h3>GEMINI PROGRAM</h3>\r\n              <h4>1963-1966</h4>\r\n              <p class=\"sectionText\">Project Gemini was NASA's second human spaceflight program. Conducted between projects Mercury and Apollo, Gemini started in 1961 and concluded in 1966. The Gemini spacecraft carried a two-astronaut crew. Ten Gemini crews and sixteen individual astronauts flew low Earth orbit (LEO) missions during 1965 and 1966.\r\n\r\nGemini's objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the Moon. It performed missions long enough for a trip to the Moon and back, perfected working outside the spacecraft with extra-vehicular activity (EVA), and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking. With these new techniques proven by Gemini, Apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations.</p> <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-was-gemini-program-58.html\">Read more here</a>\r\n          </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"info\">\r\n      <p>Hover over programs.

First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person Project Mercury, which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal of \"landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to Congress on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.</p>\r\n          <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-was-apollo-program-58.html\">Read more here</a>\r\n        </section>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <section id=\"hubble\" class=\"fadeInPage\">\r\n      <div class=\"section rutenett\">\r\n        <h2 class=\"kol-12 sectionheading\">HUBBLE TELESCOPE</h2>\r\n          <div id=\"hubbleText\" class=\"sectionParagraph\">\r\n              <h4>1990-ONGOING</h4>\r\n              <p class=\"sectionText\">Hubble, the observatory, is the first major optical telescope to be placed in space, the ultimate mountaintop.
